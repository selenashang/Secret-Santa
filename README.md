# Secret-Santa
A script that allows the randomization of a Secret Santa game. After use, a file called ```secret_santa.txt``` is automatically created so that you won't forget who is assigned to who.

***Instructions***

1) Create a file called ```players.txt```.

2) Add player names & what they want in the format of ```name: gift```. Make sure that there aren't any extra lines at the bottom of the file.

3) In Terminal, run the command ```python santa.py```. (Check that your ```players.txt``` file is in the same directory).

4) Go start your Christmas shopping!
